# Portfolio
Below are examples of my software development work and other relevant skills.


## Commercial Work
Things I've built for employers or commercial clients:

**Pigeon Systems (3 months of contracted development experience)**
- iOS Mobile Development: Contribute to the user interface and the code to connect to Bluetooth devices.

**Oregon Convention Center (1 year of programming experience)**
- [Presentation File Server (used by 2,000 clients)](https://github.com/jdsandifer/PresentationFileServer/blob/master/README.md): 
Allows speakers to upload talks ahead of time, preview them, and then have them automatically transferred 
to the presentation room's computers. We use PHP, HTML, and CSS for dynamic content delivery 
and JavaScript to control some interactions between the server and the client pages. 
Our servers have the LAMP stack: Linux box (Ubuntu), Apache server, MySQL database, and PHP code.

**Hansen Architectural Systems, Inc. (1 year of programming experience)**
- [ALUnit (published)](https://github.com/jdsandifer/ALUnit/blob/master/README.md): 
The only open source unit testing framework for AutoLISP (as of its publication). 
AutoLISP is a subvariant of LISP similar to Common Lisp in most ways.
- [AutoLISP Apps (project ended)](https://github.com/jdsandifer/AutoLISP/blob/master/README.md): 
These apps were built as reusable components that could be combined to automate and speed up drafting tasks.


## Pro-bono Work & Free Apps
Things I've built for others:

**Android**
- [ Killer Android Topics API (in progress)](https://github.com/jdsandifer/KillerAndroidTopicsApi): 
Written in Java, this API uses the Spring and Hibernate frameworks to manage a database of meetup topics for an Android app.
- [ Hillsboro Weather (published)](https://github.com/jdsandifer/HillsboroWeather/blob/master/README.md):
Consumes a REST API and interprets the JSON data to display the current weather. 
- [ Brick Fun Facts (published)](https://github.com/jdsandifer/BrickFunFacts/blob/master/README.md):
LEGO trivia app that uses official brick colors in the theme.

**Java**
- [Bible Statistics](https://github.com/jdsandifer/BibleStatistics/blob/master/README.md): 
Massive text analysis using Java 8 streams and outputting CSV files.


## Personal Projects
Things I've built for myself and my improvement as a developer:

**C**
- [Arduino Real Time Sensing](https://github.com/jdsandifer/Arduino-real-time-sensors/blob/master/README.md): 
Programmed in C for Arduino. Two real time sensors - temperature and light level - feed data to a presentation
LCD display and the serial bus for further connection.

**HTML, CSS/Sass, JavaScript**
- [Programming Language Reference List](http://codepen.io/jdsandifer/full/RGdNNN/): 
Uses React.js and JavaScript (ES6).
- [Simple Speaker Timer](https://github.com/jdsandifer/SimpleSpeakerTimer/blob/master/README.md): 
JS, CSS, and HTML compiled into a single HTML document for easy distribution across a large conference. 
Can be hosted on the web or distributed via download or USB drive.

**Android**
- [ Simple Weight Grapher (in progress)](https://github.com/jdsandifer/SimpleWeightGrapher/blob/master/README.md):
Weight tracker app that will employ an efficient data entry interface of my own design.

**Java & Python**
- [HackerRank Problems](https://github.com/jdsandifer/HackerRank/blob/master/README.md): 
Algorithms & time/space complexity (Big O) analysis with Java, Python, and JavaScript.
- [Design Patterns](https://github.com/jdsandifer/DesignPatterns): 
Some Java implementations I add to from time to time to help keep patterns fresh in my mind and learn new ones.


## Related Skills

- *Colemak:* I use this keyboard layout instead of the ubiquitous Qwerty default. Not only am I lessening the chance of typing related injuries and laying a foundation for improving my typing speed, but it's more natural for me; it just feels like I'm more connected to the keyboard and my work. This also hightlights my tenacity as it was a difficult switch that took months, but I was commited to it once I did the research and decided it was worth the investment.

- *Rubik's Cubes:* I learned to solve 90% of a Rubik's Cube on my own and then I consulted online resources to learn the last step faster than I could have on my own. I chose the method (algorithm) to learn based on how easy it would be to remember because that's most important to me in maintaining the skill. This shows my ability to find the best existing solution to a problem based on specific criteria and my discernment in choosing when it's better to go with someone else's solution than spend time creating my own.
