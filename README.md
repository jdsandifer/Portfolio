## Related Skills

- I use the Colemak keyboard layout instead of the Qwerty default. Not only am I lessening the chance of typing related injuries and creating the chance to eventually type even faster, but it's more natural - it just feels like I'm more connected to the keyboard and my work. This also hightlights my tenacity as it was a difficult switch that took months, but I was commited to it once I had done the research and decided it was worth it.

- I can solve Rubik's cubes. This is a small testament to my problem solving skills and a larger demonstration of my tenacity and my ability to find the best published solution to a problem based on my own criteria. In this case, that meant finding someone who had a solution to the last stage of the puzzle with the fewest steps so I was most likely to remember the patterns.
