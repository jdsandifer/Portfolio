# Portfolio
Below are examples of my software development work and other relevant skills.


## Commercial Work
Things I've built for employers:

**Oregon Convention Center (1 year of programming experience)**
- [Presentation File Server (used by 2,000 clients)](https://github.com/jdsandifer/PresentationFileServer/blob/master/README.md): 
Allows speakers to upload talks ahead of time, preview them, and then have them automatically transferred 
to the presentation room's computers. PHP, HTML, and CSS employed for dynamic content delivery 
with JavaScript used to control some interactions between the server and the client pages. 
Uses LAMP stack servers: Linux box (Ubuntu), Apache server, MySQL database, and PHP code.

**Hansen Architectural Systems, Inc. (1 year of programming experience)**
- [ALUnit (published)](https://github.com/jdsandifer/ALUnit/blob/master/README.md): 
The only open source unit testing framework for AutoLISP (as of its publication). 
AutoLISP is a subvariant of LISP similar to Common Lisp in many ways.
- [AutoLISP Apps (project ended)](https://github.com/jdsandifer/AutoLISP/blob/master/README.md): 
These apps were built as reusable components that could be combined to automate and speed up drafting tasks.


## Pro-bono Work & Free Apps
Things I've built for others:

**Android**
- [ Killer Android Topics API (in progress)](https://github.com/jdsandifer/KillerAndroidTopicsApi): 
Written in Java, this API uses the Spring and Hibernate frameworks to manage a database of meetup topics for an Android app.
- [ Simple Weight Grapher (in progress)](https://github.com/jdsandifer/SimpleWeightGrapher/blob/master/README.md)
- [ Hillsboro Weather (published)](https://github.com/jdsandifer/HillsboroWeather/blob/master/README.md)
- [ Brick Fun Facts (published)](https://github.com/jdsandifer/BrickFunFacts/blob/master/README.md)

**Java**
- [Bible Statistics](https://github.com/jdsandifer/BibleStatistics/blob/master/README.md): 
Massive text analysis using Java 8 streams and outputting CSV files.


## Personal Projects
Things I've built for myself and my improvement as a developer:

**Web Languages (JavaScript, CSS/Sass, HTML)**
- [Programming Language Reference List](http://codepen.io/jdsandifer/full/RGdNNN/): 
Uses React.js and JavaScript (ES6).
- [Simple Speaker Timer](https://github.com/jdsandifer/SimpleSpeakerTimer/blob/master/README.md): 
JS, CSS, and HTML compiled into a single HTML document for easy distribution across a large conference. 
Can be hosted on the web or distributed via download or USB drive.

**Java & Python**
- [HackerRank Problems](https://github.com/jdsandifer/HackerRank/blob/master/README.md): 
Algorithms & time/space complexity practice with Java and Python.
- [Design Patterns](https://github.com/jdsandifer/DesignPatterns): 
Some Java implementations I'm doing to help keep the patterns fresh in my mind.


## Related Skills

- Colemak: I use this keyboard layout instead of the ubiquitous Qwerty default. Not only am I lessening the chance of typing related injuries and laying a foundation for improving my WPM, but it's more natural for me; it just feels like I'm more connected to the keyboard and my work. This also hightlights my tenacity as it was a difficult switch that took months, but I was commited to it once I did the research and decided it was worth the investment.

- Rubik's cubes: Solving them is an example of my problem solving skills. It also shows my ability to find the best existing solution to a problem based on specific criteria: I consulted online resources to re-learn the last step faster than I could have on my own and I chose the method (algorithm) to learn based on how easy it would be to remember because that's most important to me in maintaining the skill.
