# Portfolio

Below are examples of my software development work and other relevant skills across the different areas I'm exploring.

While this list will always be in flux, it's currently still in the initial construction stages; I'll remove this note when the list is more or less complete in terms of representing my current skills and projects.

## Android

Published Apps
  - [Hillsboro Weather](https://github.com/jdsandifer/HillsboroWeather/blob/master/README.md)
  - [Brick Fun Facts](https://github.com/jdsandifer/BrickFunFacts/blob/master/README.md)
  
Apps In Progress
  - [Simple Weight Grapher](https://github.com/jdsandifer/SimpleWeightGrapher/blob/master/README.md)

## Other Java

- [HackerRank Problems](https://github.com/jdsandifer/HackerRank/blob/master/README.md)
- [Design Patterns](https://github.com/jdsandifer/DesignPatterns)

## Web Languages (JavaScript, CSS/Sass, HTML)

- [Simple Speaker Timer](https://github.com/jdsandifer/SimpleSpeakerTimer/blob/master/README.md)
- [Programming Language Reference List](http://codepen.io/jdsandifer/full/RGdNNN/): Uses React and JavaScript (ES6) to filter the list as you type in the search box.

## Other Languages

- PHP: I'm currently using this at my job working on a specialized presentation file server. The server syncs files between computers in different rooms and provides access to them at the correct presentation time for each speaker. Essentially, the presenter's files are available on their computer and easily accessible at the correct time.
- AutoLISP (a specific variant of LISP, similar to Common Lisp)
  - [ALUnit](https://github.com/jdsandifer/ALUnit/blob/master/README.md): The only open source unit testing framework for AutoLISP.

## Related Skills

- Colemak: I use this keyboard layout instead of the Qwerty default. Not only am I lessening the chance of typing related injuries and creating the chance to eventually type even faster, but it's more natural to me - it just feels like I'm more connected to the keyboard and my work. This also hightlights my tenacity as it was a difficult switch that took months, but I was commited to it once I did the research and decided it was worth it.

- Rubik's cubes: I can solve them. This is a testament to my problem solving skills and a demonstration of my tenacity. It also shows my ability to find the best existing solution to a problem based on specific criteria: I consulted online resources to figure out the last step faster than I could have on my own and I chose a method based on how easy it would be to remember because that's most important to me in maintaining the skill.
