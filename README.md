# Portfolio

Below are examples of my software development work and other relevant skills across the different areas I'm currently exploring.

## Android

Published Apps
  - [Hillsboro Weather](https://github.com/jdsandifer/HillsboroWeather/blob/master/README.md)
  - [Brick Fun Facts](https://github.com/jdsandifer/BrickFunFacts/blob/master/README.md)
  
Apps In Progress
  - [Simple Weight Grapher](https://github.com/jdsandifer/SimpleWeightGrapher/blob/master/README.md)
  - Bjerring Tournament: A linear tournament creation app for use in sports tryouts.

## Other Java

- [Bible Statistics](https://github.com/jdsandifer/BibleStatistics/blob/master/README.md)
- [HackerRank Problems](https://github.com/jdsandifer/HackerRank/blob/master/README.md)
- [Design Patterns](https://github.com/jdsandifer/DesignPatterns)

## Web Languages (JavaScript, CSS/Sass, HTML)

- [Programming Language Reference List](http://codepen.io/jdsandifer/full/RGdNNN/): Uses React 
and JavaScript (ES6) to filter the list as you type in the search box.
- [Simple Speaker Timer](https://github.com/jdsandifer/SimpleSpeakerTimer/blob/master/README.md): 
JS, CSS, and HTML
- Presentation File Server (at work): Uses a lot of JavaScript to control interactions between PHP 
on the server and the pages themselves. LAMP stack: Linux box, Apache server, MySQL database, and PHP for dynamic content delivery.

## Other Languages

- PHP: I'm currently using this at work with the presentation file server. The server syncs files between computers in different rooms and provides access to them at the correct presentation time for each speaker. (LAMP stack)
- [AutoLISP](https://github.com/jdsandifer/AutoLISP/blob/master/README.md) (a specific variant of LISP, similar to Common Lisp)
  - [ALUnit](https://github.com/jdsandifer/ALUnit/blob/master/README.md): The only open source unit testing framework for AutoLISP.

## Related Skills

- Colemak: I use this keyboard layout instead of the Qwerty default. Not only am I lessening the chance of typing related injuries and laying a foundation to type even faster, but it's more natural for me - it just feels like I'm more connected to the keyboard and my work. This also hightlights my tenacity as it was a difficult switch that took months, but I was commited to it once I did the research and decided it was worth it.

- Rubik's cubes: I can solve them. This is a testament to my problem solving skills and a demonstration of my tenacity. It also shows my ability to find the best existing solution to a problem based on specific criteria: I consulted online resources to re-learn the last step faster than I could have on my own and I chose the method (algorithm) to learn based on how easy it would be to remember because that's most important to me in maintaining the skill.
